#  Same.dev â€” AI-Powered Website Builder

Same.dev is an **AI-powered full-stack website builder** inspired by platforms like [bolt.new](https://bolt.new).  
With just a **prompt**, it can generate a complete project end-to-end â€” including the frontend, backend, and supporting utilities.  

The goal of Same.dev is to **make software development as simple as describing what you want**.  
Whether you need a landing page, a dashboard, or a backend service, Same.dev builds the entire project inside a **monorepo** with a clean and scalable architecture.

## Introduction

Modern web development often requires stitching together multiple tools:
- A **frontend framework** (like React/Next.js)  
- A **backend runtime** (like Node.js or Bun)  
- A **state management system**  
- A **database layer**  
- Shared utilities and build tooling  

This can be overwhelming, especially for rapid prototyping or when you just want to get something running fast.

**Same.dev solves this problem** by combining:
- **AI-driven code generation** â†’ describe your project in plain English, and let the system scaffold the entire app.  
- **Monorepo architecture with Turborepo** â†’ keeps frontend, backend, and shared packages in one place.  
- **Next.js frontend** â†’ delivers a production-ready, SSR-enabled UI.  
- **Bun-powered backend services** â†’ provides ultra-fast execution for APIs and background tasks.  
- **History tracking** â†’ every generated project is stored and can be revisited later.  

With these pieces, Same.dev provides a **developer-first experience**, enabling both beginners and professionals to build and iterate on apps faster than ever.
